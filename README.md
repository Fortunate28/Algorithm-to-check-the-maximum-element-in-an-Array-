The algorithm is a C program that checks for the maximum element in an array.
A for loop is used to iterate through all elements in the array comparing them to a maximum value that is initially set to the first element
of the array and it is updated as the loop runs. 
If the element at the current position of the array is greater than the max value, 
the max value is updated to the current element and the cycle continues untill all array elements are checked.
